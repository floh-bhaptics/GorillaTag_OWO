# GorillaTag_OWO
Basic OWO support for Gorilla Tag

## Installation

1. Get the [MelonLoader installer](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=automated-installation) and install it on your game executable.
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/floh-bhaptics/GorillaTag_OWO/releases/latest/download/GorillaTag_OWO.zip) of the mod and unzip the contents into the "Mods" directory in your game folder.
